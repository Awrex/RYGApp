\n\n\n  How We Share Information We Receive or Collect with Others
\n  How Your Information Is Shared
\nRaiseYourGame may share information we receive or collect in a variety of ways, such as:
\n• When you give RaiseYourGame permission through an affirmative election (for example, clicking "yes" in response to a message such as "share my email with this advertiser").
\n• If we contract or partner with third parties to provide specialized services on our behalf, such as credit card processors, customer support, ad servers or other providers of advertising services, bulk email processors who send out emails on our behalf, or parties who assist us with sweepstakes management and prize fulfillment. These companies are authorized to use your personal information only as necessary to provide these services to RaiseYourGame. They are not authorized to use your personal information for their own, unrelated purposes.
\n• To measure and analyze Service usage. For example, we use third-party providers such as Nielsen and ScorecardResearch to measure how long and how frequently you are using the Service. Our advertising partners may use these providers to measure the effectiveness of their advertising campaigns. When we use these providers, we provide them with non-personally identifiable information about you, such as your device identifier.

\n\n\nSharing of Personally Identifiable Information
\nWe do not share personally identifiable information with third parties other than as described in this policy. However, we may share your information, including personally identifiable information, in order to (i) protect or defend the legal rights or property of RaiseYourGame, or the legal rights of our business partners, employees, agents, and contractors (including enforcement of our agreements); (ii) protect the safety and security of RaiseYourGame users or members of the public including acting in urgent circumstances; (iii) protect against fraud or to conduct risk management; or (iv) comply with the law, legal process, or legal requests. Additionally, we may share your data, including any personally identifiable information, with our successor in interest in the event of a corporate reorganization, merger, or sale of all or substantially all of our assets.

\n\n\nSharing of Device Data
\nRaiseYourGame may share information from devices you use to access the Service with its third-party vendors or service providers, manufacturing or distribution partners, or advertising partners.

\nRaiseYourGame may share with third parties, advertisers, and/or business partners anonymized, non-personally identifiable, or aggregated data we receive or collect, such as de-identified demographic information, de-identified location information, information about the computer or device from which you access the Service, or information about competency sorts. We share such information for a variety of reasons, such as to analyze Service usage, improve the RaiseYourGame Service and your user experience, improve the serving of advertisements, understand trends, or for other similar purposes. The use and disclosure of such anonymized, non-personally identifiable, or aggregated information is not subject to any restrictions under this policy.

\n\n\nManaging Your Information

\nModification of Your Registration Data
\nWe provide you with the ability to modify your Profile data.

\n\nRetention of Your Registration Data and other Information
\nWe will retain and use your Profile Data and the other information we collect about you for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you Services.
